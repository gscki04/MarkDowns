### ðŸ”¥ What is Hot Module Replacement (HMR) in Angular?

**Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** is a powerful feature used during development that **updates modules in the browser at runtime without a full page reload**.  

It keeps the **application state** (like form inputs, scroll positions, etc.) **intact**, while injecting updated code.

### âœ… Benefits of HMR

| Feature                | Description                                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| âš¡ **Faster Development** | No full reload â†’ faster feedback loop                       |
| ðŸ”„ **Preserves State**     | Keeps your appâ€™s current state (e.g. form values)           |
| ðŸ’» **Better DX**          | Developer Experience improves significantly                 |

### ðŸ”§ How to Enable HMR in Angular

1. **Add HMR support**:
```bash
ng add @angular-devkit/build-angular
```

2. **Enable HMR in `angular.json`**:
Find your project config under `architect > serve > options`, and set:
```json
"hmr": true
```

3. **Run with HMR**:
```bash
ng serve --hmr
```

### ðŸ“Œ Without HMR:
- Every change reloads the whole app
- You lose state, scroll, inputs, etc.

### ðŸ“Œ With HMR:
- Only changed parts are replaced
- State stays intact unless changed in code

---

### ðŸ’¡ Example Use Case:
Youâ€™re designing a multi-step form and want to tweak styles or logic in one step. With HMR:
- You change the code
- It updates instantly in the browser
- The form doesn't reset â€” you stay on the same step

---

Latest Angular application (Angular 11 & above) do not need to add HMR explicitly.  


### ðŸ”§ How to use HMR in Angular project

You just need to run this command:

```bash
ng serve --hmr
```

> ðŸ§  This will automatically activate HMR in dev mode.

---

### âœ… Optional: Add a script for easier use

You can simplify it by adding this to your `package.json` scripts section:

```json
"start:hmr": "ng serve --hmr"
```

Then just run:

```bash
npm run start:hmr
```
