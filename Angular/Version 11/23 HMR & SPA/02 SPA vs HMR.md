### 🧩 What is SPA (Single Page Application)?

**SPA** means:
- The app loads **one single HTML page** (`index.html`)
- All content/views are loaded **dynamically using JavaScript**
- There is **no full-page reload** during navigation
- Uses **Angular Router** to swap views without reloading the page

✅ Example: Navigating from `/login` to `/dashboard` happens in-memory without reloading the browser.

### 🔥 What is HMR (Hot Module Replacement)?

**HMR** is a **development-only feature**:
- Updates **only changed modules** (code/files) live in the browser
- Avoids full page reload during development
- Helps **retain app state** (form data, scroll, etc.)
- Makes coding/debugging **faster & smoother**

✅ Example: You edit a component's HTML → HMR updates just that component in the browser, without losing what you typed in a form.

### 💡 Think of it like this:

- **SPA** is what your **users** experience  
- **HMR** is what **you** (developer) experience while building the app
