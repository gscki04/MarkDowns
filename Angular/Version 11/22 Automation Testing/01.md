in Manual testing we give our project to Tester to test the application. & tester test each & everything manually like forms, flow/navigations, inputs/outputs, validations & error messages etc    
in Automation testing does exactly but instead of a person(tester) code does it. we run it though command line & it test the what we written in testing code (Faster and repeatable, Ensures consistency & catches bugs early)  
## Example:  
case: our application name should be blog  
the testing file will look like this  
```typescript
it(`should have as title: "blog"`, ()=> {
    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
    const app = fixture.componentInstance;
    expect(app.title).toEqual('blog');
});
```

## How it works  
- Manual testing takes too much time
- make test cases of all important functions
- run these test case with terminal

## Types of automation testing  
- Unit testing: Test small pieces (functions, components)    
- Integration: Test combined pieces (e.g., service + component)   
- Ent-to-End: Test the entire app like a user would  
unit & ETE are mostly known in automation testing  

## When to use  
- Large-scale projects
- Stable codebase
- Regression testing
- CI/CD pipelines  

## When not to use  
- Small, rapidly changing projects
- Tight deadlines (initial phase)
- Prototypes or POCs
- where requirements keep changing    

## Angular(10) automation testing tools  
1. Protector: Run test case on browser  
2. Jasmine: Testing enviroment, run specs file for the test case  
3. karma: run test in multiple browser
