#### 1. **Importing Required Modules**

```typescript
import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';
import {DataResult, orderBy, process, SortDescriptor} from '@progress/kendo-data-query';
import {Observable, of} from 'rxjs';
import {products} from '../dummyData/data.products';
```

* **`@angular/core`**: This imports the `Injectable` decorator, which makes the service class injectable into other components.
* **`@progress/kendo-data-query`**: This imports specific functions and types from Kendo UI's data query utilities:

  * **`DataResult`**: Represents the result of a data operation (like sorting or filtering). It contains the `data` and `total` (total number of items).
  * **`orderBy`**: A function used to apply sorting to the data based on the provided sort descriptors.
  * **`process`**: A function used to filter and sort data. It is part of Kendo's query utilities.
  * **`SortDescriptor`**: Represents the sorting criteria (field and direction).
* **`rxjs`**: The `Observable` and `of` are imported from the RxJS library. `Observable` is used for asynchronous programming, and `of` is used to wrap the result in an observable stream.
* **`products`**: This is an array of product objects that you defined earlier, which contains the dummy data for your grid.

#### 2. **Defining the Service**

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class ProductService {
```

* **`@Injectable()`**: This decorator marks the `ProductService` as a service that can be injected into components or other services in Angular. It allows Angular to manage the service's lifecycle and dependencies.

#### 3. **The `getProducts` Method**

```typescript
public getProducts(
    skip: number, pageSize: number, sortDescriptor: SortDescriptor[],
    filterTerm: number | null
): Observable<DataResult> {
```

* **`getProducts`** is a public method in the `ProductService`. It accepts:

  * **`skip`**: The starting index for paging.
  * **`pageSize`**: The number of products to be fetched per page.
  * **`sortDescriptor`**: An array that defines the sorting rules, such as which field to sort by and whether it should be ascending or descending.
  * **`filterTerm`**: A filter value to filter the products by category. It can be `null` if no filtering is applied.
* **`Observable<DataResult>`**: The method returns an observable that will emit a `DataResult`, which contains the data for the current page (filtered and sorted), as well as the total number of products.

#### 4. **Filtering and Sorting Logic**

```typescript
let data;
if (filterTerm) {
  data = process(orderBy(products, sortDescriptor), {
    filter: {
      logic: 'and',
      filters: [{ field: 'CategoryID', operator: 'eq', value: filterTerm }]
    }
  }).data;
} else {
  data = orderBy(products, sortDescriptor);
}
```

* **`orderBy(products, sortDescriptor)`**: This function sorts the `products` array according to the criteria defined in `sortDescriptor`.
* **`process(...)`**: This function is used to filter and process the data.

  * If a `filterTerm` (category filter) is provided, it applies the filter to only show products that match the selected category (`CategoryID`).
  * The filter condition used is: `field: 'CategoryID', operator: 'eq', value: filterTerm`, meaning it filters products where the `CategoryID` matches the `filterTerm`.
  * If no filter is provided (`filterTerm` is `null`), it simply returns the products sorted according to `sortDescriptor`.

#### 5. **Returning the Data**

```typescript
return of({ data: data.slice(skip, skip + pageSize), total: data.length });
```

* **`data.slice(skip, skip + pageSize)`**: This slices the `data` array to return only the products for the current page. It uses the `skip` value (starting index) and the `pageSize` (how many items to return).
* **`total: data.length`**: This returns the total number of items in the data (before slicing). This will be used by the grid to display the correct pagination information.
* **`of(...)`**: The `of` function from RxJS is used to wrap the result in an observable. This is required because Angular expects an observable to handle asynchronous operations, even though the data here is static.

#### 6. **Summary of Method Behavior**

* The method `getProducts` returns an observable of a `DataResult` object.

  * **`data`**: Contains the paged and filtered product data.
  * **`total`**: The total number of items before pagination (for proper grid pagination).

### **What This Service Does**

The `ProductService` class helps manage the product data by:

* **Sorting** the data based on user input.
* **Filtering** the data based on the selected category.
* **Paging** the data based on the current page and number of items per page.

The service provides the data to the component in a format that the Kendo UI Grid can use directly, including handling the sorting, filtering, and paging on the backend side.
