### Basic Formula to Articulate Programming Concepts:
Use the **"What + Why + How + Example"** structure:

1. **What** ‚Äì Define the concept in *1 simple line*.  
2. **Why** ‚Äì State the *purpose or use-case*.  
3. **How** ‚Äì Explain how it works (*logic/flow/steps*).  
4. **Example** ‚Äì Give a *tiny real code snippet or analogy*.

### Example 1: ‚ÄúWhat is a Class in Java?‚Äù

- **What:** A class is a blueprint for creating objects in Java.  
- **Why:** It allows us to group related data and functions.  
- **How:** You define it using `class`, then create objects using `new`.  
- **Example:**
  ```java
  class Car {
      String color;
      void drive() { System.out.println("Driving"); }
  }
  Car myCar = new Car();
  ```

### üí° Quick Tips:
- Use **analogies**: e.g., *Class is like a blueprint, object is the house built from it.*
- Don‚Äôt go into **internal mechanisms** unless asked.
- Always **tailor depth** based on listener (fresher vs experienced dev).
- Use **short examples**, not full programs.
