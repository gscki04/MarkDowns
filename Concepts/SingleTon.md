## 🧠 What is a Singleton?

A **Singleton** is a **design pattern** that ensures a **class has only one instance** during the lifetime of an application — and it provides a **global point of access** to that instance.

### 🔁 Real-World Analogy:

Imagine a **printer** in an office.  
No matter how many people send print requests, there's only **one printer**.  
Everyone accesses the **same printer** instead of creating a new one each time.

Same idea with singleton — one shared instance used everywhere.

### ✅ Why Use Singleton?

- Efficient use of **resources** (memory, network, etc.)
- Ensures **consistency** — everyone gets the same data/state
- Useful for **shared services**, like:
  - Auth services
  - API services
  - Configuration or Logging
